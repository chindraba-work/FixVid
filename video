# Command script to launch extract_video with all the proper parameters
# set. May launch the extraction multiple time if there are multiple
# occurances of the video configuration variables.
#
# Accepts 1 optional argument:
#     group_num   Which setting group to use in extraction.
#                 A value of "0", or no argument, will cycle through
#                 all the available groups, extracting a video for
#                 each. Any other number will extract one video,
#                 using the group number to determine which one to
#                 use.
#
# Reads fixvid.conf for:
#     video_label_n
#     video_codec_n
#     video_params_n
#     video_equalizer_n     The eq video filter settings
#     video_adjust_n
#     video_complex_n
#         where "n" is an integer number beginning at "1"
#
# Displays nothing.

# Generates 0 files:
