# Command script to launch subtitle creation commands with all the
# proper parameters set. May launch the extraction multiple time if
# there are multiple occurrences of the configuration variables.
#
# Accepts 1 optional argument:
#     group_num   Which setting group to use in extraction.
#                 A value of "0", or no argument, will cycle through
#                 all the available groups, creating subtitles for each.
#                 Any other number will create one subtitle file using
#                 the group number to determine which settings to use.

# Reads fixvid.conf for:
